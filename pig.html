			<p>Pig is a <span class="inline-h3">big</span> fishbone tabby who loves to eat, hiss and sleep. He was born somewhere in the spring of 2012. He is very talkitive, demanding, affectionate, anthropophobic<span class="inline-h6">*</span> and dominant. Some of his nicknames are Piggy Boy, Pig Pig, Pig Boy and Piglett. His favorite place to sleep is behind the heater in the basement.<br></p>
			<h5 style="font-weight: 350;">* Anthropophobia is the fear of new people or people in general. In this case, I am using it as the former.</h5>
