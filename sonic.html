      <p>Sonic is a cat who is probbally russian blue but we don't know so we say he's gray. He loves to hide and cuddle his brother. He was born around the 30th of July 2024. 
      We like to call him Sonny, Sonic Bubonic, Sonic Bubonic Plague, and Loafy. 
      He loves to sleep on a cat bed at the bottom of his cat tree because it's right next to his heater.</p>
