			<p>Bert is an ummm… actually, I have no clue what he is. We’re pretty sure he was born somewhere in the spring of 2014. He likes to sleep, vomit, eat and be a lap cat. He’s needy, affectionate and playful. Did you know the average cat sleeps for 12 to 16 hours a day? I think Bert took that as a challenge. Some of his nicknames are Bizzles, Berty Bizz, Bertles and Berty Boy. His favorite place to sleeping is on the white chair in the living room.</p>
