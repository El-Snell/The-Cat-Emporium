			<p>Lucky was born on May 25, 2025 in my house. He
 		 	is a gray tuxedo who is almost always off playing with his
 	 	 	sister, Bean. He’s very independent, a bit lazy and occasionally
      cuddly. Some of his nicknames are Lucky Duck, Ducky, Duck
 		  Butt and Duck Duck. He is “lucky” because we helped him
 	 		start breathing when he was born.</p>
